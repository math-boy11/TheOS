# TheOS or HTMLOS
This is an operating system written in HTML. It has a few programs like a Calculater, Calendar, Terminal, and Text Editor! I made this project because I had nothing else to do, and to test out my web skills!

# Installation
Go into your folder and clone the repository. Then, run the index.html file. This Project Does not work for safari, The date and time glitch out. It's recomended to go full screen mode on your web browser and go View > Always show toolbar in fullscreen for Google Chrome. On Firefox, you need to install an add-on for this task: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fullscreen_plus/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fullscreen_plus/).
